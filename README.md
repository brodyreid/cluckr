# Cluckr

I created a Twitter-style website that allows users to sign-in, post Clucks (tweets), view current Clucks (in order of when they were posted), post images, and sign-out.

It is written in `JavaScript` with `Express.js` and uses `Knex.js` to communicate between the `PostgreSQL` database and the site.
